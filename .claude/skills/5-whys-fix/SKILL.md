# 5-Whys Fix — Root Cause, Not Symptom

## Purpose

Stop fixing symptoms. Drive to the actual cause, weigh real options, then fix and prove it. A patch
that hides the symptom while the cause survives just defers the same bug.

## When to Activate

- "why did this break", "root cause this", "5 whys", "fix it properly"
- Any recurring bug, or one whose obvious fix feels like a bandaid

## Protocol

### 1. State the symptom precisely

What is observably wrong? Include the exact error, the input that triggers it, and what *should* have
happened instead. Reproduce it before theorizing.

### 2. Ask "why" five times

Each answer must be evidence-backed (a log line, a code path, a value), not a guess. Stop early only
when you hit a cause that, if fixed, makes the whole chain impossible — not just this instance.

```
Symptom → why? → why? → why? → why? → why? → ROOT CAUSE
```

### 3. Propose three solutions

- **Tactical** — smallest fix at the root cause.
- **Structural** — removes the class of bug, not just this one.
- **Preventive** — a guard/test/type that stops it recurring silently.

Name the trade-off of each (effort vs. durability).

### 4. Pick one and justify

Default to the structural fix unless effort is disproportionate. Say why you chose it.

### 5. Fix and verify

Apply the fix, then prove it independently (see the `verify` skill): the original repro no longer
triggers, AND nothing adjacent broke. Add the preventive guard so it can't silently return.

## Rules

- Every "why" needs evidence — no speculative chains.
- A fix that doesn't change the answer to the deepest "why" is a bandaid; say so.
- Always add the regression guard, or the same incident comes back.
